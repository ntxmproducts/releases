## 👋 What is this?

I originally built TypeMaster as a web app because I was tired of boring typing tests. I wanted to practice my *flow* and *rhythm*, but practicing with "the quick brown fox" or a jumble of random words just felt like a chore.

My solution was **Story Mode**—a feature that lets you practice by typing out chapters from classic literature.

So many of you asked for a way to use it without a browser (and all its distractions) that I decided to build this: a **100% free, 100% offline desktop app.**

## ✨ Key Features

  * **💻 100% Offline:** No internet connection needed. Practice anywhere, anytime.
  * **🧘 Distraction-Free:** No browser tabs, no notifications. Just you and the words.
  * **📚 Story Mode:** Improve your flow by typing out real stories, not just random words.
  * **⏱️ Standard Tests:** Still want to check your WPM (Words Per Minute) and accuracy? The classic test mode is included.
  * **🕊️ Lightweight & Free:** It's a tiny file and 100% free, forever.

## 💾 Installation

It's a standard Windows installer. Just:

1.  **Download** the `.msi` file from the link above.
2.  **Double-click** the file to run the installer.
3.  **Follow the prompts.** Windows SmartScreen might ask you to confirm—just click "More info" \> "Run anyway."
4.  Once installed, you'll find TypeMaster in your Start Menu.
