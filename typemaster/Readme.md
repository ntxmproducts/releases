## 👋 What is this?

TypeMaster was originally built as a web app because I wanted a more enjoyable way to practice typing — something beyond the usual “quick brown fox” or random word generators.

That led to **Story Mode** — where you get to type out real classic literature. It helps build rhythm, flow, and confidence.

A lot of users requested an offline version, so here it is:
✅ 100% free
✅ 100% offline
✅ Works great without the noise of a browser
